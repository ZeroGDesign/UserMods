Simple tool to square the x extrusion to the frame of the printer.

Can be used with belts on or off and while the printhead is installed (both afterburner and EVA). Also can be used during or after assembly of your Mercury One.

Uses 6 M5x8 or M5x10 bolts and 6 T-nuts (3 per tool).

Make sure to print out two of these.

Instructions for use:

1) Loosen belts and x extrusion mounting bolts.

2) Bolt onto the x extrusion:
