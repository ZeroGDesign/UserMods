Simple tool to square the x extrusion to the frame of the printer.
Can be used with belts on or off and while the printhead is installed (both afterburner and EVA). 
Uses 6 M5x8 or M5x10 bolts and 6 T-nuts (3 per tool).
Make sure to print out two of these.

Instructions for use:

1) Loosen belts and x extrusion mounting bolts.

2) Bolt onto the x extrusion:
