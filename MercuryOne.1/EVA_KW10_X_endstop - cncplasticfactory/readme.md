## Introduction

A mount and bumpstop to work with the EVA hotend system using a KW10 microswitch (as commonly found on Creality 3D printers) as the X endstop. 

These are based on the dimensions of KW10s purchased seperately to a Creality Ender 5, but assuming the hole spacing is the same, should work with almost any KW10.

The mount is based on the 'Openbuilds' mount by the EVA team, but modified to suit KW10s.

## Installation

The bumpstop is designed as either a 'dumb' bumpstop, with the large vertical face used to trigger the endstop, or can have an M3 bolt screwed into it to act as a trigger for the endstop. 

In the latter configuration, the bumpstop can be used with the flat face pointed towards or away from the endstop, depending on the length of the M3 bolt you wish to use and your desired trigger point.

The bumpstop should be mounted on one of the Mercury One's X joints. You'll need to replace one M5x12mm with an M5x16mm to mount it on the X joint.
