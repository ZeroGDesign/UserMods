## Introduction

This is a modified version of the Mercury One Y endstop mount for KW10 microswitches. 

The original did not fit the KW10 microswitches I purchased. 

This modified version slightly enlarges the mounting area for the KW10, including adjusting the pin locations and the small 'shelf' to suit.
