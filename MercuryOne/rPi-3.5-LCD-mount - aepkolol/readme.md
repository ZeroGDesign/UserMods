Used this to mount an Adafruit 3.5" TFT screen to the front of the ender 5 frame. Enough room behind it to mount the rPi directly to the screen and not get in the way of anything.

stuff on the front is extruded 0.6mm deep, so you can print the first 3 layers in your accent color, then the remainder in another color.

Included the fusion360 file to customize it up as you want.
